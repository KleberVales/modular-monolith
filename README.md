<p align="justify">
A Modular Monolith is a software architecture style where an application is built as a single deployable unit (like a traditional monolith), but internally it is carefully structured into independent, well-defined modules. It combines the simplicity of monolithic deployment with the maintainability and scalability benefits of modular design.</p>

### Key Concepts of Modular Monolith

- **Single Deployment Unit**  
The entire application is packaged and deployed together, unlike microservices where each service is deployed separately.
