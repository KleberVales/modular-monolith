<p align="justify">
A Modular Monolith is a software architecture style where an application is built as a single deployable unit (like a traditional monolith), but internally it is carefully structured into independent, well-defined modules. It combines the simplicity of monolithic deployment with the maintainability and scalability benefits of modular design.</p>
